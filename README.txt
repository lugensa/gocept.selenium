===============

gocept.selenium provides an API for the `Selenium remote control`_ that is
suited for writing tests and integrates this with your test suite for any WSGI,
Plone, Zope 2, ZTK, or Grok application.

While the testing API could be used independently, the integration is done
using `test layers`_, which are a feature of `zope.testrunner`_.
