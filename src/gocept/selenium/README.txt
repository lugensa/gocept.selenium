Selenium RC integration with zope.testing
=========================================

gocept.selenium integrates the `Selenium remote control`_ with your test suite
for any WSGI, Plone, Zope 2, ZTK, or Grok application.

Prerequisites
-------------

Install Selenium RC by some means, e.g. by downloading a version from
`seleniumhq.org`_ . We do not recommend using the
``collective.recipe.seleniumrc`` buildout recipe for this since we have had
some bad experiences with it related to new versions of Selenium RC and
Firefox.

Quick start for WSGI applications
---------------------------------

You can test any WSGI application using gocept.selenium by doing:

#. Require gocept.selenium for your tests.

#. Create a layer for your tests::

    import gocept.selenium.wsgi

    from mypackage import App

    test_layer = gocept.selenium.wsgi.Layer(App())

#. Inherit from `gocept.selenium.wsgi.TestCase`::

    class TestWSGITestCase(gocept.selenium.wsgi.TestCase):

        layer = test_layer

Quick start for WSGI applications (Zope 2)
------------------------------------------

When running Zope 2 as WSGI application you might see the following
exception when running tests::

  File ".../repoze.retry-1.0-py2.7.egg/repoze/retry/__init__.py", line 55, in __call__
    cl = int(cl)
   ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''

To fix it you can use an additional middleware around your WSGI
application: ``gocept.selenium.wsgi.CleanerMiddleware``. It also fixes an
issue with ``wsgiref``. See comments in the code for more information.


Quick start with ZTK (zope.app.testing)
---------------------------------------

Assuming that you already have a package that uses ``zc.buildout`` and
``zope.app.testing``, you need to do this to enable Selenium tests:

#. Add gocept.selenium to the list of eggs either in your setup.py, or in
   buildout.cfg, using the extra ``ztk``, i.e. ``gocept.selenium[ztk]``.

#. Run buildout to install gocept.selenium and selenium (the Python bindings
   for Selenium RC).

#. Create a layer for your tests, like this::

    import gocept.selenium.ztk
    import zope.app.testing.functional
    zcml_layer = zope.app.testing.functional.ZCMLLayer(
        'ftesting.zcml',
        __name__, __name__, allow_teardown=True)
    selenium_layer = gocept.selenium.ztk.Layer(zcml_layer)

   Essentially, the ``zcml_layer`` is what you would use for typical ZTK
   functional tests, and then you wrap it to create the ``selenium_layer``.

#. Start writing tests that inherit ``gocept.selenium.ztk.TestCase``; make
   sure you set the ``layer`` attribute to ``selenium_layer`` on each test
   class.

#. In your tests, use ``self.selenium`` to control Selenium RC, e.g. ::

    class MyTest(gocept.selenium.ztk.TestCase):

        layer = selenium_layer

        def test(self):
            self.selenium.open('http://%s/foo.html' % self.selenium.server)
            self.selenium.assertBodyText('foo')

#. Run seleniumrc::

    $ java -jar /path/to/selenium-server.jar

#. Run `bin/test` and see it work!


Quick start with ZTK (zope.app.wsgi)
------------------------------------

Assuming that you already have a package that uses ``zc.buildout`` and
``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer``, you should follow the steps described in `Quick
start with Grok`_.


Quick start with Zope 2/Plone (general)
---------------------------------------

Essentially the same like `Quick start with ZTK (zope.app.testing)`_, just:

* depend on `gocept.selenium[zope2]` resp. `gocept.selenium[plone]` instead
  of `gocept.selenium[ztk]`.

* use ``gocept.selenium.zope2`` resp. ``gocept.selenium.plone`` instead of
  ``gocept.selenium.ztk``.

Quick start with Zope 2/Plone (plone.testing)
---------------------------------------------

If you use `plone.testing` to set up the test layers for your Zope2
resp. Plone package you can follow these steps:

#. Depend on `gocept.selenium[zope2]` resp. `gocept.selenium[plone]` in your
   `setup.py`.

#. Create a `plone.testing` layer which loads your package and its ZCML
   configuration. (See documentation of `plone.testing` how to do this.)

#. Create a layer for the selenium tests like this::

    selenium_layer = gocept.selenium.zope2.Layer(MY_PLONE_TESTING_LAYER)

   (You might need to exchange ``zope2`` by ``plone`` in this statement.)

#. Create a test case and run the tests like described in `Quick start with
   ZTK (zope.app.testing)`_. But use ``gocept.selenium.zope2.TestCase`` resp.
   ``gocept.selenium.plone.TestCase`` instead of
   ``gocept.selenium.ztk.TestCase`` as test base class.



Quick start with Grok
---------------------

This layer works a little different than in the ZTK steps above. Instead of
delegating to a (probably already existing functional testing) layer, you'll
need a separate one for the selenium tests.

#. Use the ``grok`` extra when requiring gocept.selenium.

#. Create a layer for your tests::

    import gocept.selenium.grok

    selenium_layer = gocept.selenium.grok.Layer(my.package)

#. Inherit from `gocept.selenium.grok.TestCase`. You will probably want to
   setup your app in your test setup::

    import transaction

    class MyTest(gocept.selenium.grok.TestCase):
        layer = selenium_layer

         def setUp(self):
             super(MyTest, self).setUp()
             root = self.getRootFolder()
             root['app'] = mypackage.App()
             transaction.commit()

         def test(self):
             self.selenium.open('/app')
             self.selenium.assertBodyText('foo')

Quick start with plone.testing
------------------------------

#. Use the ``plonetesting`` extra when requiring gocept.selenium.

#. gocept.selenium provides a plone.testing.Layer,
   ``gocept.selenium.plonetesting.SELENIUM`` that you can mix and match with
   your other layers, see plonetesting.testing/plonetesting.tests.zope2 and
   plonetesting.testing_plone/plonetesting.tests.plone{3,4} for some examples
   of integrating with Zope2 and Plone, respectively.

Selenium HTML tests conversion script
-------------------------------------

Selenium tests can be written in HTML tables.

Their syntax is a bit clunky. But their development and debugging is eased a
lot by using Selenium IDE Firefox extension.
Selenium IDE provides both initial recording of tests and stepping through
those tests.
However, HTML tests have a main drawback : they are hard to include in a
continuous integration system.

``gocept.selenium`` provides a script that converts a set of
Selenium HTML tests into a Python module (based on ``gocept.selenium`` and
``plone.testing``). That Python module contains a ``TestCase`` that can be included in any
``zope.testing`` test suite.

Using the ``converthtmltests`` script, the developer can use HTML tests - written,
debugged and maintained with the Selenium tools -
while being able to easily include those Selenium
tests in a continuous integration system.

Usage
~~~~~

See hereunder an excerpt of the help provided by the script ::

    converthtmltests -l LAYER [options] directory

    options:
      -f FILE, --file=FILE  write tests to FILE
      -l LAYER, --layer=LAYER
                            full python import path to layer instance

The script gathers and converts all Selenium HTML tests found in the mentioned
directory.

The user must refer to a ``plone.testing`` layer by specifying its Python import path.
That layer is set on the test case generated in the Python module.

An output file can be specified. In case no output file name is specified,
the module produced is named ``tests_all_selenium.py``.


Controlling gocept.selenium through environment variables
---------------------------------------------------------

You can configure the selenium server that gocept.selenium connects to from the
command line. Selenium RC defaults to localhost:4444, but you can also connect
to a selenium grid in your organization by using the following environment
variables::

    GOCEPT_SELENIUM_SERVER_HOST=selenium.mycompany.com
    GOCEPT_SELENIUM_SERVER_PORT=8888

If multiple browsers are connected to your selenium grid, you can choose the
browser to run the tests with as such::

    GOCEPT_SELENIUM_BROWSER=*iexplore

When you are running your selenium tests on a selenium grid, you need to
instruct the browser which host and port to connect to::

    GOCEPT_SELENIUM_APP_HOST=10.0.0.15
    GOCEPT_SELENIUM_APP_PORT=8001

The default for the port to bind is 0 which let the kernel choose a random,
free port.  

When you are testing an application on one machine, you can access the running
application from another machine if you set ``GOCEPT_SELENIUM_APP_HOST =
0.0.0.0`` instead of the default ``localhost``. 

You can set the speed with which the tests are run through an environment
variable::

    GOCEPT_SELENIUM_SPEED=500

This example will introduce a 500 millisecond pause between tests.


Test helpers
------------

Skipping tests for certain browsers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are cases when a test should does not pass on certain browsers. This is
either due to the application using browser features which are not supported by
the browser, or due to selenium not working well with the browser. To aid in
skipping tests in these cases, there is a test decorator
``gocept.selenium.skipUnlessBrowser(name, version=None)``:

    >>> class TestClass(...):
    ...
    ... @gocept.selenium.skipUnlessBrowser('Firefox', '>=16.0')
    ... def test_fancy_things(self):
    ...     ...


.. NOTE:: ``skipUnlessBrowser`` *only* supports skipping test methods. It cannot
         be used as class decorator.

.. WARNING::
    The version test is only supported for Python >= 2.5. For Python < 2.5
    *only* a name check can be performed. Giving a version number will skip the
    test unconditionally.
