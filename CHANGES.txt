Changes
=======

0.6 (2010-08-09)
----------------

- assertXpathCount now also takes ints (#7681).

- API expansion: add ``isChecked`` to verify checkboxes, ``runScript``,
  ``clickAt``, ``getLocation``, ``getSelectedValue``, ``getSelectedIndex``.

- The ``pause`` method uses float division now. Pauses where implicitly rounded
  to full seconds before when an int was passed.

- The name of the factored test layer contains the module of the bases now. The
  name is used by zope.testrunner distinguish layers. Before this fix selenium
  layers factored from base layers with the same names but in different modules
  would be considered equal by zope.testrunner.

- The factored ZTK layer cleanly shuts down the http server in tearDown now.
  This allows to run different selenium layers in one go.


0.5 (2010-08-03)
----------------

- Add a static files test layer for running selenium tests against a set
  of static (HTML) files.
- Patterns now also work with multiline strings,
  i. e. 'foo*' will match 'foo\nbar' (#7790).


0.4.2 (2010-05-20)
------------------

- API expansion: ``*keyDown``, ``*keyUp``, ``keyPress``.


0.4.1 (2010-04-01)
------------------

- API expansion: added ``getSelectedLabel``.

- Ignore the code of a server's response when calling `open`. The default
  behaviour of SeleniumRC changed between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 but we want the old
  behaviour by default.


0.4 (2010-03-30)
----------------

- API expansion: add ``getLocation`` to retrieve currently loaded URL in
  browser.

- API expansion: added ``waitForPopUp``, ``selectPopUp``, ``deselectPopUp``
  and ``close``.

- API expansion: added ``verifyAlertPresent``, ``verifyAlertNotPresent`` and
  ``waitForAlertPresent``.

- Usability: raise a better readable exception when an unimplemented selenese
  method is called.

- Usability: raise failure exceptions that convey the name of the failed
  assertion in spite of some lambdas wrapped around it.


0.3 (2010-01-12)
----------------

- Extracted 'host' and 'port' as class attributes of gocept.selenium.ztk.Layer
  so subclasses can override them; stopped hardcoding 8087 as the server port.


0.2.1 (2009-12-18)
------------------

- Fix incomplete sdist release on PyPI.


0.2 (2009-12-18)
----------------

- Make Zope 2 test server reachable from the outside.
- Implemented getTitle/assertTitle/waitForTitle/etc.


0.1 (2009-11-08)
----------------
