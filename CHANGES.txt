Changes
=======

0.5.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Move the browser selection from the test layer to the testcase baseclass in
  order to be more flexible in choosing the browser. As a consequence, the
  browser is started multiple times which is slower, but it will be easier to run
  the tests against multiple browser types by merely subclassing the concrete
  testcases and setting a different browser attribute.

- Add utility method for creating multiple test cases for mutiple browsers from
  one test case.


0.4.2 (2010-05-20)
------------------

- API expansion: ``*keyDown``, ``*keyUp``, ``keyPress``.


0.4.1 (2010-04-01)
------------------

- API expansion: added ``getSelectedLabel``.

- Ignore the code of a server's response when calling `open`. The default
  behaviour of SeleniumRC changed between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 but we want the old
  behaviour by default.


0.4 (2010-03-30)
----------------

- API expansion: add ``getLocation`` to retrieve currently loaded URL in
  browser.

- API expansion: added ``waitForPopUp``, ``selectPopUp``, ``deselectPopUp``
  and ``close``.

- API expansion: added ``verifyAlertPresent``, ``verifyAlertNotPresent`` and
  ``waitForAlertPresent``.

- Usability: raise a better readable exception when an unimplemented selenese
  method is called.

- Usability: raise failure exceptions that convey the name of the failed
  assertion in spite of some lambdas wrapped around it.


0.3 (2010-01-12)
----------------

- Extracted 'host' and 'port' as class attributes of gocept.selenium.ztk.Layer
  so subclasses can override them; stopped hardcoding 8087 as the server port.


0.2.1 (2009-12-18)
------------------

- Fix incomplete sdist release on PyPI.


0.2 (2009-12-18)
